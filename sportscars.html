* Re-designed 5.0 litre twin-turbo V8 engine producing 1280hp on standard gasoline and 1600hp on E85 biofuel (in some markets)
* Revolutionary new 9-speed Koenigsegg Light Speed Transmission (LST)
* Advanced aerodynamics offering over 1000kg of downforce
* Active rear-wheel steering
* Re-designed carbon fibre chassis with more legroom, headroom and greater visibility
* Jesko is named for Jesko von Koenigsegg, the father of company Founder and CEO, Christian von Koenigsegg.</p>
<h1>Bugatti chirron</h1>
<img src="bugatti.jpeg" width="1000px">
<p> The CHIRON is the fastest, most powerful, and exclusive production super sports car in BUGATTI’s history. Its sophisticated design, innovative technology, and iconic, performance-oriented form make it a unique masterpiece of art, form and technique, that pushes boundaries beyond imagination.

BUGATTI owes its distinctive character to a family of artists and engineers, and has always strived to offer the extraordinary, the unrivalled, the best. Every element of the CHIRON is a combination of reminiscence to its history and the most innovative technology. The result is a unique creation of enduring value, and breathtaking automotive accomplishment.</p>
<h1>Henessey venom f5</h1>
<img src="venomf5.jpg" width="1000px">
<p>After an extensive two-year long engineering and development phase, the Hennessey team has done it again.  The company has built an all new carbon fiber chassis that will serve as the foundation of the Venom F5.

 

Built entirely of carbon fiber, the all-new ground-up design has been engineered and built to propel the Venom F5 to a top speed of over 500 kilometers per hour (310.7+ mph).  The new F5 chassis is both strong and light weight.  Torsional rigidity has been measured at 52,000 newton meters per degree (38,353 lb-ft torque per degree) and the total weight is just 86 kilograms (190 lbs).

 

“Our all new carbon fiber chassis is an engineering marvel and to see it in person is like looking at a piece of artwork.  It’s like a piece of automotive jewelry that’s built to run 500+ km/h,” said company founder and CEO, John Hennessey.</p>
<h1>Ferrari laferrai</h1>
<img src="ferrari.jpg" width="1000px">
<p>It boasts the most extreme performance ever achieved by a Ferrari production car and features the most advanced and innovative technical solutions which will, in the future, filter down to the rest of the Ferrari range. The LaFerrari is Ferrari’s first ever production car to be equipped with the F1-derived hybrid solution – the HY-KERS system – which combines an electric motor producing over 150 CV with the most powerful incarnation yet of Ferrari’s classic V12, with 800 CV at 9000 rpm.</p>
<h1>Mclaren F1</h1>
<img src="mclarenf1.jpg" width="1000px">
<p>Power, pace and peerless quality, the legendary F1 is a technological masterpiece. The fastest production car of its time. The finest sports car of its generation. For many, the greatest supercar ever built.</p>
