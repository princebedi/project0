<h1>lamborghini urus</h1>
<img src="urus.jpg" width="1000px">
<P>The Lamborghini Urus is much lighter than most of its competitors (i.e. the BMW X6 M, Bentley Bentayga and Rolls-Royce Cullinan, but not the Porsche Cayenne) at less than 2,200 kg (4,850 lb) as quoted by the manufacturer[9] mainly because of the extensive usage of carbon fibre reinforced polymer, although it is based on the same platform as the Audi Q7, Bentley Bentayga, Porsche Cayenne, and Volkswagen Touareg.[10] The engine is rated at a maximum power output of 478 kW (641 hp; 650 PS) at 6,000 rpm and maximum torque of 850 N⋅m (627 lb⋅ft) at 2,250–4,500 rpm. The Urus has a front-engine, all-wheel-drive layout,[10][11] and a top speed of 305 km/h (190 mph) making it one of the world's fastest production SUVs. The Urus can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.6 seconds and 0–200 km/h (124 mph) in 12.8 seconds. Lamborghini has developed the world's largest set of carbon ceramic disc brakes[citation needed] for the Urus, with 440 mm (17.32 in) discs in the front and 370 mm (14.57 in) discs in the rear using ten-piston callipers at the front and single-piston callipers at the rear. The all-wheel drive system of the Urus under normal driving sends 40 percent of the engine's torque to the front wheels and 60 percent to the rear wheels.</P>
<h1>rolls royce cullinan</h1>
<img src="cullinan.jpg" width="1000px">
<p>A unique aluminium spaceframe underpins Cullinan, along with new Rolls-Royce chassis technology, to deliver the signature Rolls-Royce magic carpet ride. The driving experience is peerless, whatever the conditions, as you savour a luxury SUV journey of unparalleled comfort.
Making millions of calculations every second, self-levelling air suspension cushions against the toughest surfaces, all proactively adjusting to acceleration, steering cues and camera intelligence. While the double wishbone front axle and five-link rear axle deliver agility and stability.</p>
<h1>range rover</h1>
<img src="land rover.jpg" width="1000px">

Wherever you go in Range Rover Velar, eyes will follow.From effortless, crisp acceleration to improved efficiencies and lower CO2 emissions, the engine that powers the Range Rover Velar has been optimised.

<h1>jeep wrangler</h1>
<img src="jeep.jpg" width="1000px">
<p>The 2020 Jeep Wrangler is what the Jeep brand is all about—with roots that date back to the original World War II–era military vehicle—and its off-road capability borders on amazing. While it looks much like the first-generation Jeep that was created to support our troops, it has evolved into a one-of-kind four-wheel-drive vehicle, with tech and luxury to match its off-road chops. It offers everything from air conditioning to leather. Two mild-hybrid engines are available; a stretched, four-door version called the Wrangler Unlimited is also available. No matter what version you get, you can still remove the doors and roof, fold down the windshield, and enjoy motoring through the great outdoors.</p>
